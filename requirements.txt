CustomItems1 — build requirements & libraries

This is a Spigot/Bukkit (Minecraft server) plugin written in Java.

Build requirements

You’ll need a JDK that matches the Minecraft version you’re targeting. It is built for 1.21+ so use at least JDK 17.

The project is built with Maven, so mvn -v should work.

Runtime requirements

Run it on a Spigot/Paper server that matches your target version (Paper is what I’d use for local testing).

I used manual dowloading for these libraries as I had a problem with dowloading bbg via Maven. You can try dealing with it if you'd modify it further.
